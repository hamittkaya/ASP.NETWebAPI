I used the Singleton design pattern in the project because I want an object to do just one job.
I used the technologies I used before. (Mssql,Repository design pattern, Ioc Container,EntityFramework,ASP.NET Web API,.Net Core Framework)
I would like to add Log,Cache to the project,on the Frontend side I would love to use Ajax.
I used the entity framework code first.
Creating a migration for the database will be sufficient
I did the project in a short time, sorry for the mistakes :)
